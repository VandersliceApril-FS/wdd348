# home-library

## Motivation
The main idea behind this app came when I was homeschooling my son during the pandemic lockdown. I was buying so many children's books some were in Apple Books, others were through Amazon's Kindle Unlimited, and then some were physical books. It was getting harder to keep track of what books we had and where they were so that's where the idea for this app came. With more time and experience I would add a way to categorize or tag books based on location in the home or digital vs physical. For now it serves a general purpose of keeping track of cataloguing books in one's personal library. 

## Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

*To get started [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) components were used for a lot of the design, but have since been mostly replaced with custom components.*

## Other Build Notes
- As previously mentioned, CSS was initially done using React Bootstrap but has been replaced with custom styling.
- App.css is labeled by component/page and properties are sorted alphabetically
